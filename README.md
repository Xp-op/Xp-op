### About
I like Python(not that snake). At first I like C++ until I realize that Rust is much safer.
Currently, I'm interest in Programming Language Design like making my own interpreter or compiler.

### Current Project
I'm making my own programming language, Derex. It would be dynamically typed.

### Languages that I learned so far
- Python
- C++
- C
- Java (Java is memory consuming and slow)
- C#
- asm x86 (not really)
- html (not a programming language but still a language)
- css (not a programming language but still a language)
- Javascript
- Rust
